Driv3r Hook
=======

A simple DLL-injection module for hooking into Driv3r, allowing for further control of the game. ([Sound familiar?](https://github.com/Fireboyd78/MM2Hook))

It's been hiding away on my computer for the last 4 years, not doing much of anything, but here it is!

Recently, I've gotten it working and doing some exciting things! I just need to get around to documenting everything...eventually!

## Features
There's like, tons of stuff it can do, man. I just uhh, have to double check my notes here...

## Installation
There's no way to do this at the moment, unless you've got Visual Studio 2017 on hand and ready to compile this monstrosity.

More detailed instructions will follow eventually. Stay tuned!
